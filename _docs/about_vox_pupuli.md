## Who can join?

Anyone can participate in voxpupuli. We currently have four levels of
participation, orchestrated by github teams.

* Everyone with a github account can submit pull requests and review code.
* Module contributors have commit/merge access to a subset of the modules in
  voxpupuli, usually the modules they maintained before joining
  voxpupuli.
* Collaborators have commit/merge access to a subset of the modules in
  voxpupuli.
* Administrators have the authorization to create new repositories and
  publish modules to the forge under the puppet namespace.

## Where you can find us

We have a number of communication channels:

* #voxpupuli on [Libera](https://web.libera.chat/?#voxpupuli), aka IRC
* [#voxpupuli](http://puppetcommunity.slack.com/messages/voxpupuli/) on
  [Puppet Community](http://slack.puppet.com), aka Slack
* [Mailing List](https://groups.io/g/voxpupuli/)

IRC still counts as the preferred point of contact for many of us but we tend
to be available and reachable through both. If you need to reach out to a
maintainer because of behaviour in our community that you find questionable
please read through our [Code of Conduct](/coc), you'll find a contact address there.

Longer form cross-project discussion tends to take place on the mailing list,
as well as release announcements.

## Project management committee

We defined a [governance document](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/blob/master/share/governance.md#vox-pupuli-governance)
some time ago. It defines several different groups and roles. One of them is
the PMC. For 2019 [we
elected](https://voxpupuli.org/blog/2018/12/19/election-results-2019/) 5
people.

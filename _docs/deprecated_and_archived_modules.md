## Archived Modules

It is Vox Pupuli's mission to provide a home for modules so that development can continue after the original authors/maintainers have moved on.
In rare circumstances, a module may be archived and placed into a read-only state.  This typically will only occur if the module/project no longer serves a valid
purpose.  For example, a module that interacted with a discontinued 3rd party service.

If you come across an archived Vox Pupuli project that you are still using or think should not have been archived, [let us know][email].
The decision to archive a module isn't necessarily final and can be undone.

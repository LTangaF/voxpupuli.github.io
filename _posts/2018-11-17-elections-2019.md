The Vox Pupuli project is now more than three years old. It represents many
different collaborators, and numerous repositories of tools, plugins, and
modules. In order to make this project successful in the long term, we elect a
list of PMC officers to make big decisions and guide the organization in the
right direction. This is all laid out in the [governance document][gd].

TL;DR The Committees members are elected by the community for 1 year. They take
care of the Code of Conduct and its values, participate in strategic planning,
amongst other things. [Read more about the committee and its selection][elections].

The PMC has set [Kris Bosland][kris] to be the Election Officer and to run the
elections, as stated in the [Governance Document][gd]. Kris is not running
for PMC re-election.

Nominate yourself or someone else by following the directions [here][e].

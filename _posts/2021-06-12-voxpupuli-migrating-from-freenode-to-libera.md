In the summer of 2021 a lot happened around freenode. The IRC network is now
maintained by new people. As a consequence many open source communities
migrated their channels to [Libera.chat][lb]. Many freenode staff resigned
and published resignation letters with background information. One from fuchs
is available [here][fuchs], one from amdj can be found [here][amdj]. Freenode
published a [counterstatement][cs]. Many former freenode staff member now
operate Liberat.

We as Vox Pupuli do not want to comment on the history between the former staff
and the new owner. But as a consequence we will migrate our channels as well.

You can now find us in `#voxpupuli` on Libera. This change was discussed on our
[public mailing list][ml]. With the publishing of this blogpost we will also
update our website and all existing blogposts to point to Libera instead of
freenode.

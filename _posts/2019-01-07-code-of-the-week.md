This is a new blog series that we would like to introduce. At Vox Pupuli, we
receive many [Pull Requests](https://github.com/search?q=type%3Apr+is%3Aopen+is%3Apublic+org%3Avoxpupuli&type=Issues). We receive so much awesome code, that isn't really
appreciated. In the past, some of our members sent out tweets if they saw cool
code. We now want to start a blog series with regular updates to appreciate the
work of our collaborators and contributors.

We continue in week two with an unusual, but awesome, contribution. A long time
ago [emlun007](https://github.com/emlun007) created a very fancy logo for our
[puppetboard](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard#puppetboard) project!
Sadly,
[this contribution](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/434#issuecomment-346133556)
slipped through:

<img alt="8bit vox" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/puppetboard-logo.jpg"/>

Another collaborator, [Sebastian Rakel](https://github.com/sebastianrakel), was
so kind to separate the image from the background (he kind of patched it -
this pun is required to qualify this for the `Code of the Week` series):

<img alt="8bit vox" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/static/images/puppetboard-logo-seperated.png"/>

We receive a lot of actual Puppet code as contributions, but there are so many
other things that are important as well. Such as updates for documentations or
logos. Did you know that we have a
[dedicated repository](https://github.com/voxpupuli/logos#voxpupuli-logos) for
all the logos and images we have?

Thank you emlun007 and Sebastian for this cool contribution!

Did you spot some cool code as well? Write a

or write an email to our
[Project Management committee](mailto:pmc@voxpupuli.org) or just drop a note on

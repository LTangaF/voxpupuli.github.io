This year, we have five people self-nominate to be PMC members for the next year. As we only had 5 nominations and 5 seats, there was no need to run an election.

With that, I'm excited to annouce the following new members of the Project Management Committee for the 2018 year:

* Tim 'bastelfreak' Meusel
* David 'dhollinger' Hollinger
* Hunter 'Hunner' Haugen
* Alex 'afisher' Fisher
* Eric 'eputnam' Putnam

Thanks to all that participated and a special thanks to Spencer 'nibalizer' Krum for organizing the nomination and election process!

This will be a great year!
